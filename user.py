    General: Class User gets the users url, scrapes all the information into class variables
    inheritance: "create_soup" from class Website.

                The idea behind dictionary inheritance is to allow the developer to protect the data that can be
                scraped into the database and prevent a scenario where the data is added / subtracted from the user.
                This feature is ready to deploy on the product demand.

                In addition, dictionary methods allows us to store the data in a structure that can be transfer
                to a Jason file without creating any additional variables. â€“ O(n) time and space complexity.

                for clarity reasons all class variables are being declared at the top of the class. All class
                variables who needs more than one line to scrap the information are being scraped in separate blocks
